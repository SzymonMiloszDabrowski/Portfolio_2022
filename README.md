# My Portfolio

The repository shows the code of my portfolio page which contains my projects and form to contact with me. I decided to create this page as simple as possible, that's why I used only:

- HTML
- Sass
- Javascript

Additionally to help test and deploy the project I used some packages like:

- autoprefixer
- browser-sync
- copyfiles
- cssnano
- npm-run-all
- onchange
- postcss-cli
- sass
